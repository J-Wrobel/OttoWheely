My take on DIY educational mobile robot Otto

# Status
At the moment I am slowly working on the project. I plan the robot to be two-wheeled differential platform robot. For the electronics I am going with arduino nano and some off-the-shelf (or aliexpress rather) arduino modules. The body of the robot will be modeled and 3d printed. The project has now some inital and test code.
